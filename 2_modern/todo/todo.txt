----- Notes -----
Strict mode:
1. Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors
2. Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations:
   strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that's not strict mode
3. Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.
